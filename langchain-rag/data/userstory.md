### **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Form Fields**:

   - The form must have the following input fields:
     - **First Name**: Required text field.
     - **Last Name**: Required text field.
     - **Email Address**: Required text field, must follow a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).

     - **City**: Required text field.
     - **State**: Required dropdown selection or text field.

2. **Password Requirements**:

   - The password must:
     - Be at least **8 characters long**.
     - Contain at least **1 number** (0-9).
     - If the password does not meet these criteria, a validation message must be displayed to the user (e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least 1 number").

3. **Validation**:

   - Each field is required and should display an error message if left blank upon form submission.
   - If any validation fails, the form should:
     - Prevent submission.
     - Highlight the invalid fields with appropriate error messages (e.g., "First name is required", "Invalid email format", "ZIP code must be 5 digits").
   - Password validation should trigger dynamically as the user types to inform them whether their password meets the criteria.

4. **Success Criteria**:

   - If all fields are correctly filled in and the password meets the requirements, the form should submit successfully.
   - Upon successful submission, the user should receive a confirmation (e.g., “Your account has been created”) and be redirected to the login screen or welcome screen of the online banking app.

5. **Form Design**:

   - The form should be responsive, accessible, and user-friendly across all device sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet).
   - A "Submit" button should be present at the end of the form to allow submission.
   - A "Cancel" or "Back" button should be available to allow users to navigate back if they change their mind.

6. **Security**:
   - All data must be transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection.
   - Password input should be masked for privacy (e.g., dots or asterisks).
   - Email and password must be stored securely in the backend following industry-standard encryption and security best practices (e.g., salted and hashed passwords).
