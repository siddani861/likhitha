### Test Plan: Pet Walking SaaS App

#### Overview

This Test Plan outlines the test strategy for ensuring the Pet Walking SaaS App meets functional, non-functional, security, and performance requirements. It covers key testing aspects, including user journeys for both pet owners and walkers, the matching algorithm, payment system, notifications, and user experience.

The testing phases will involve functional tests, usability testing, performance testing, security assessments, and edge case handling. Both automated and manual tests will be employed to ensure the system is robust, secure, and user-friendly.
